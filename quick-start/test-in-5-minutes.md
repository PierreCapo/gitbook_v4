# Sample

Using our sample repository, in 5 minutes you can see a Paywall inside your app which will give you a nice glimpse of our technology.

If you need a full tour of the console, you can [book a demo](https://www.purchasely.com/plan-demo).&#x20;

The Example application delivered on the public Repo ([iOS](https://github.com/Purchasely/Purchasely-iOS), [Android](https://github.com/Purchasely/Purchasely-Android)) will be working with sample `API_KEY` and `PRODUCT_ID` that will allow you to display an offer.

You can test different presentations:

* `CAROUSEL`
* `FEATURE_LIST`

You can use these informations to setup your app SDKs on [iOS](../quick-start-1/sdk-installation/ios-sdk.md) or [Android](../quick-start-1/sdk-installation/quick-start.md) and run the SDK within your app.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You won't be able to purchase or restore an item because your app won't have the correct bundle Id and won't be signed with the correct certificate. \
This step will only allow you to display the presentation and have some taste of what your integration would look like.
