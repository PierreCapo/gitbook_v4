# Testing

You can test a complete purchase flow by using a sandbox account with Apple and Google

When testing In-App Purchases in a Sandbox environment, the duration cycles of the subscriptions are shortened to be able to evaluate behaviour for Auto-renew cycles.

\
**After 5 renewals your Subscription is automatically cancelled.**

\
All confirmation emails are sent by the App store to the email address used for testing.

\
See below for the time correspondence :
