# SDK configurations

With SDK v3, Purchasely moves from a monolith to a modular system composed of 3 modules:

* Transaction processor: Cross-platform management of subscriptions and one-time purchases
* Subscriber Data Hub: Real-time subscription lifecycle events used to fuel our dashboards and integrations like [Firebase analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics), [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com), [Airship](https://www.airship.com/fr?), [Braze](https://www.braze.com), [Batch](https://batch.com), [Segment](https://segment.com), â€¦
* User Journey Optimizer: Our Paywall CMS to create and optimize native subscription screens



That way Purchasely can be used in many ways to:

* Perform purchases
* Analyse purchases that were made with your own IAP system (aka _observer mode_)
* Display paywalls
* Use everything offered by Purchasely without changing your own transactional system

And of course everything listed above.



To reflect these compositions, you have to select a `runningMode` when you initialize Purchasely:

* `transactionOnly`
* `observer`
* `paywallObserver`
* `full`
