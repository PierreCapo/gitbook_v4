# Design your Paywalls

## About _**Paywalls**_

In Purchasely Cloud Platform Console, you can directly configure your paywalls and integrate your own design & contents. This is achieved thanks to **Paywalls**.

Purchasely proposes a set of fully customisable templates to choose from. These templates are compliant with Apple App Store review guidelines to help you pass the App Review.

A Paywall can be **ACTIVE** or **INACTIVE**.

If you create multiple Paywalls, only one (and at least one), shall be set as the **DEFAULT** Paywall

## Configuring a _Paywall_

The Paywall configuration screen is composed of 4 thumbnails :

* General : allows you to choose the template you want to use and set the **Paywall** general parameters
* Featuring contents : allows you to integrate your own contents inside the **Paywall**
* Purchase buttons : allows you to create the Purchase buttons of the **Paywall** and map each button with the corresponding **Plan**
* Localization : allows you to translate your **Paywall** in as many languages as you want

### General properties

A **Presentation** has the 3 mandatory properties :

* **Name** : this is the name of the **Presentation** inside the Purchasely Console. This value is not displayed to the users.
* **Vendor ID** : this is the **Presentation** unique identifier and you can set it to the value you want. It will be used in the SDK to display a specific **Presentation**. To keep data and conversion analysis consistent, this value should not be changed once the App has been released in production.
* **Template type** : this parameter defines the general layout of the **Presentation**

Depending on the template chosen, you can then set general styles & contents properties for the presentation.

### Featuring Contents

Featuring contents help you integrate your own contents into the presentation. You can create as many featuring contents as you want and order them as desired (simply drag & drop them).
