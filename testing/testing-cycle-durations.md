# Testing Cycle Durations

When testing In-App Purchases in a Sandbox environment, the duration cycles of the subscriptions are shortened to be able to evaluate behaviour for Auto-renew cycles

After 5 renewals your Subscription is automatically cancelled.\
All confirmations emails are sent by the App store to the email address used for testing.

See below for the time correspondance :
