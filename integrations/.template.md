# ${INTEGRATION_NAME}

## Why combine ${INTEGRATION_NAME} and Purchasely?

### Pre-requisites

The minimal version of the Purchasely SDK supporting this integration is //TODO: Kevin. If the Purchasely SDK integrated in your app is under the minimal version, please update it.

The ${Integration_name} SDK also needs to be integrated inside the app.

### Subscription events

### General overview

[${Integration_name}](${integration_website_url}) is a leading //TODO: Yoann

This integration will allow you to get all the available Purchasely events to ${Integration_name} and get a better and deeper understanding of your subscription business and customer behavior.

Purchasely provides a unified dataset to track the subscription events for all stores. These events are generated by the Purchasely Backend and can be sent to ${Integration_name}.

Subscription events generated by Purchasely will be sent to ${Integration_name} using a server-to-server integration. As a result, you will be able to see all the subscription events in your ${Integration_name} Dashboard and map them with your acquisition campaigns.

#### Events

The following events are the main ones that can be sent to ${Integration_name} by Purchasely. See the full list [here](onesignal.md#subscription-events).

The names of events sent to ${Integration_name} can be overriden when setting up the integration.

## **Integrating Purchasely with ${Integration_name}**

The integration requires ${integration_setup_steps_count} steps:

1. Associate the user to events by providing the `${integration_sdk_property}` to the Purchasely SDK
2. Activate the ${Integration_name} integration in the Purchasely Console

### 1. Associating users to events

See the [${Integration_name} Documentation](${integration_documentation_url}) for more information

### 2. Activating the ${Integration_name} integration

The activation requires ${integration_setup_activation_steps_count} steps:

1. // Retrieving your ${Integration_name} ${API_SETUP_VALUE} from ${Integration_name}'s dashboard
2. // Retrieving your ${Integration_name} ${OTHER_API_SETUP_VALUE} from ${Integration_name}'s dashboard
3. Enabling the ${Integration_name} integration in the Purchasely Console

#### a. // Retrieve your ${Integration_name} ${API_SETUP_VALUE} from ${Integration_name}'s dashboard

1. Follow [the ${Integration_name} documentation](${integration_documentation_url})
2. Write down your ${API_SETUP_VALUE}

#### b. // Retrieve your ${Integration_name} ${OTHER_API_SETUP_VALUE} from ${Integration_name}'s dashboard

1. Follow [the ${Integration_name} documentation](${integration_documentation_url})
2. Write down your ${OTHER_API_SETUP_VALUE}

#### c. Enabling the ${Integration_name} integration in the Purchasely Console

1. Go in the "External integrations" section, and open the edition form for ${Integration_name}:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/ // Link to screenshot>)

2\. Enable the integration

3\. Set your ${Integration_name} ${integration_property}

4\. Set your ${Integration_name} ${integration_other_property}

![](<../.gitbook/assets/ // Link to screenshot>)

5\. Enable the events you want to be sent to ${Integration_name}

6\. (Optional) Override the names of the events that will be sent to ${Integration_name}

![](<../.gitbook/assets/ // Link to screenshot>)

7\. Save

### Testing your integration

To test your integration, you can perform a set of in-app purchases in a Sandbox environment (eg: TestFlight for the App Store) and verify your events are received in the ${Integration_name} dashboard [https://fly.customer.io/login](https://fly.customer.io/login).
