# v2.1.3

Prior to version 2.1.3, the developers had only one method to login and logout a user which was `setUserId` with a defined parameter (to login) or `null` to logout.

To disambiguate that, we replaced it with 2 much more understandable methods: `userLogin` and `userLogout` .

So call `userLogout` only when the user really logs out.

Passing nil on `start` method won't logout the user.
