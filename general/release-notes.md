{% endhint %}

ðŸš¨ Important: This SDK version uses StoreKit 2 by default. [Read the documentation](https://docs.purchasely.com/quick-start-1/sdk-configuration/storekit-2) for more information. You can still use StoreKit 1 by changing the configuration with [Purchasely.start(storekitSettings: .storeKit1)](https://docs.purchasely.com/faq/migration-guides/sdk/migrate-to-sdk-v4.0.0#initialization-update)

**This version includes the following features and improvements:**

1. **Timer Tags:** Timer tags have been added to all fields of the paywall with a specific date. This feature allows you to set timers in various formats throughout your paywalls, promoting specific offers for a limited time. For instance, you can set a countdown to the end of Black Friday, and the timer will continuously display the time remaining until that date.
2. **Metadata for Your Own Paywall:** Utilizing the "Your Own Paywall" template feature, you can now customize your paywalls with _Purchasely_ technology, including tags. This customization feature enables you to update your paywalls dynamically using variables, known as metadata. This flexibility allows for the seamless integration of client-specific paywalls and _Purchasely_ paywalls within the same application, providing similar benefits.
3. **Minor Improvements:** Additionally, this version includes numerous minor enhancements and refinements to enhance the overall user experience.

#### Google Play Billing v5 Integration

* **Version**: Purchasely SDK 4.0.0 now integrates with Google Play Billing v5 (5.2.1). This ensures you have access to the comprehensive features introduced in the latest version of Google's in-app subscriptions.
* **Action Required**: Review your plans on the Purchasely console to confirm the presence of a `basePlan` identifier.

#### Promo Offers (Google only)

* **New Feature**: Excitingly, we're introducing support for [promotional offers](../advanced-features/promotional-offers.md), known as `developer determined offers`, on the Google Play Console.
* **Action Required**: When setting up your `developer determined offers` in the Google Play Console, make sure to tag them as "**ignore-offer**". This ensures that the Purchasely SDK doesn't automatically apply them to all your paywalls. Instead, they'll be used exclusively where you've specified.

#### Build Configuration Update

* **Android Gradle Plugin**: Updated to 8.1.0
* **Kotlin**: Upgraded to 1.8.10
* **Compile SDK**: Now on version 33
