**This version includes the following features and improvements:**

1. **Timer Tags:** Timer tags have been added to all fields of the paywall with a specific date. This feature allows you to set timers in various formats throughout your paywalls, promoting specific offers for a limited time.

2. **Metadata for Your Own Paywall:** Utilizing the "Your Own Paywall" template feature, you can now customize your paywalls with _Purchasely_ technology, including tags. This customization feature enables you to update your paywalls dynamically using variables, known as metadata. This flexibility allows for the seamless integration of client-specific paywalls and _Purchasely_ paywalls within the same application, providing similar benefits.
