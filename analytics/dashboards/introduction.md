# Introduction

Purchasely has a unique set of subscriber lifecycle events. They are used for your marketing automations but they also fuel our analytics engine and multiple dashbord to help you follow the health and strength of your subscription business.

You have access to 4 different dashboards that cover each topic and concerns about your subscriptions:

* [**Live**](live.md)**:** Get a real time overview of your subscriber base and how it is changing today
* [**Subscriptions**](subscriptions.md)**:** Have a better understanding of your subscriber base and MRR evolution
* [**Cohorts**](cohorts.md)**:** Analyse your retention and your conversion by cohorts
* [**Trials**](trials.md)**:** See your trial to paid conversion and its evolution

Additionally we added a way to visualize the [**events**](events.md) evolution and export it.
