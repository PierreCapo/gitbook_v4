# Cohorts

## Retention cohorts

Cohorts help you see retention over time by group of subscribers.

* The first two columns show the period (month, week, day) and the total number of subscribers.
* The third column show the number of remaining person on the first period
* Each row contains the retention of people who started their subscription at a particular period. The last item corresponds to the current month and numbers will probably change

## Trial cohorts

This dashbord offers a way to see how different cohorts converted from a trial / intro offer price to a paid subscription.

For each period (bar) you can see how many people that started a trial have converted it or are still enjoying the trial.
