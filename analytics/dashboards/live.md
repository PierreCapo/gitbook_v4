## Active subscribers

This page gives the repartition repartition between connected and [anonymous subscribers](../../advanced-features/anonymous-user.md).

Forcing your users to register before being able to purchase will probably lower down your conversion as you are adding multiple steps ahead of the payment. Anonymous purchases helps you on this but as you will work on conversion and retention, knwoing your customer and being able to reach him on a cold channel like email is important.

You will probably offer your anonymous customers to register after the purchase but this might not be enough and you will want to monitor this and this dashboard was built for that purpose.

## Inactive subscriptions causes

A subscriber churns for many reasons. Understand the reasons why your subscribers churned with this dashboard:

* Terminated: The subscription naturally ended after the user canceled the renewal
* Refunded: The user asked the store to be refunded
* Unpaid: The subscriptions stoped because of a billing issue
* Paused: The subscriber chose to pause the subscription that might start at any time
* Billing retry: There was a billing issue on the subscription that entered a grace period that wasn't successful

Additionaly, we display the total fraud attempts that was blocked by Purchasely.
